# DayZ Server IP - TS3 plugin
![alt-text](doc/png/main_window.png)
## About
This plugin can show and automatically distribute and update the IP and name of the server that you're playing on across all your teammates in your channel. No more need to type the IP into the chat yourself or to join via Steam's friendlist.

## Features
>TODO documentation

## Usage
There is a [manual](doc/MANUAL.md) that'll get you up and running in a minute!

## Download
The plugin itself is just one file named `dayzsrvip.dll`, available as plain `.zip` or `.ts3_plugin` package on the [releases](https://github.com/dehesselle/dayzsrvip/releases) page.  
You need a recent 64bit version of [TeamSpeak](http://www.teamspeak.com) that provides plugin API v20. Just update to the latest version if you're not there already (at the time of writing: 3.0.19.4) and you're good to go.

## Build
Building this yourself is pretty straight forward: download and install Visual Studio 2013 and Qt 5.5.1. Open the project `plugin/dayzsrvip.pro` in Qt Creator and start compiling.

## Known Issues
Currently none - time to get this tested in the field!
