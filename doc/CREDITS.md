# Credits
This would not have been possible without the work of other people. Most obviously, without [TeamSpeak](http://http://www.teamspeak.com) and their [client plugin SDK](http://forum.teamspeak.com/threads/46439-Client-Plugin-SDK) this would still be a standalone program requiring some custom server backend. In fact, more than one year ago, that was the initial prototype.
